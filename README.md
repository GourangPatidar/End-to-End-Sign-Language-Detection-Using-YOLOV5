# End-to-End-Sign-Language-Detection-Using-YOLOV5

## Introduction 
 Welcome to the YOLOv5 HAND SIGN project documentation! This project focuses on detecting and recognizing six different hand gestures using the YOLOv5 deep learning model. The hand gestures include "hello," "yes," "I love you," "Please," "Thanks," and "no."

## Project Overview
The YOLOv5 HAND SIGN project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection architecture, specifically YOLOv5, to detect and classify hand gestures in images or videos. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its accuracy and speed.

## Hand Gestures
1. Hello: A waving hand gesture.
2. I Love You: A hand gesture representing "I love you" in sign language, with the pinky, index   finger, and thumb extended.
3. No: A hand gesture for indicating negation or disagreement with a shaking motion.
